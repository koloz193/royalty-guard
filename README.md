# RoyaltyGuard

A general mixin for any owned/permissioned nft contract that allows for fine tuning permissions based off an ALLOW or DENY list. The best example of a use case at this point in time is the enforcement of royalty payouts through selecting which platforms are/arent allowed to move tokens on a users behalf.

## Contracts
